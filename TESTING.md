# TESTING

The project was tested constantly throughout the development process. I had multiple users try out my website on multiple web browsers to spot bugs or grammatical mistakes which they found and I corrected.

## Validation Testing

### Python Validation
I used the Code Institute Python Linter to ensure sure the source code throughout was PEP8 compliant. No errors/warnings were detected.
