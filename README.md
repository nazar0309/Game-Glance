# Game Glance

Hello Fellow Gamers!

Welcome to [**Game Glance**](https://game-glance0309-8d0894eb4eb4.herokuapp.com/), an interactive platform where gaming enthusiasts can explore a curated list of games, view detailed descriptions, and engage with the community by leaving reviews. Registered users can manage their reviews directly from the game description page, with the ability to edit or delete them if the review belongs to them. Users also have access to a Profile Page, where they can view all the reviews they have created and search for specific reviews using the search bar.
