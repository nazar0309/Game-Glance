# Wireframes

This project includes a set of wireframes illustrating the layout and structure of the user interface, providing a visual guide to the design and functionality across different pages and devices. The wireframes serve as a blueprint, outlining essential elements such as navigation, key content areas, and user interaction points. These visuals ensure alignment on the layout and user experience before diving into detailed design and development.
